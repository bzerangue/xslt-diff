This is an XSLT comparison script that compares the variable file b.xml with the input xml and outputs the difference using XSLT
1.0 in an microsoft standard.
I have designed this as an orderless comparison with node rearrangement in the
parent not being regarded as a difference.

It is a one sided comparison so differences will only be items in the input xml not in the b.xml

For instance:
input.xml
<root>
   <a test="test"></a>
   <b></b>
   <c></c>
<root>

b.xml
<root>
    <a test="not-this-test"></a>
    <b></b>
    <d></d>
</root>

Would output:
<comparison-result>
<mismatch>
   <a test="test"></a>
</mismatch>
<mismatch>
   <c></c>
</mismatch>
</comparison-result>

This file will cause a stack over flow exception due to heavy recursion in an xslt debugger however will still run fine run using the standard
microsoft engine.
